1. **Add Product Page**: Create an "Add Product" page with a form for users to add products. The form should include fields for Image, Name, Brand Name, Type, Price, Short Description, Rating, and an "Add" button. This is a protected route.

2. **Brand-Based Products Page**: When clicking on a brand, users should be redirected to a page displaying products based on that brand. This page should include a slider with at least three advertisement images and at least four products. Each product should display Image, Name, Brand Name, Type, Price, Rating, Details button, and Update button. If a brand has no available products, display a relevant message.

3. **Product Detail Page**: Clicking on the "Details" button on the product page will take users to a product detail route. The product detail page should provide detailed information about the product. Include an "Add to Cart" button.

4. **Authentication**: Implement email and password-based authentication, including registration and login pages. Users should be able to toggle between Login and Registration views. Display errors for password criteria and login mismatches.

5. **Third-party Login**: Implement at least one extra login method (e.g., Facebook, GitHub, Google).

6. **Navbar User Menu**: Once logged in, display the user's name, profile picture, and a logout button in the navbar. Clicking on the logout button should log the user out.

7. **My Cart Page**: Create a "My Cart" page where users can view and delete their added products. This is a protected route.
